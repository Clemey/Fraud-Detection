Fraud Detection in Mobile Money

Fraud detection research in financial services, especially mobile money, faces a data gap due to the privacy of financial transactions. The PaySim simulator addresses this by creating synthetic datasets that mimic real-world mobile money transactions. It uses aggregated data from private sources to simulate regular activity and inject fraudulent behaviour, allowing researchers to test fraud detection methods without risking sensitive information.

PaySim is based on a sample of real mobile money transactions from an African country, provided by a multinational company with services in over 14 countries. This synthetic approach provides a valuable resource for advancing fraud detection research. Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection (kaggle.com)
